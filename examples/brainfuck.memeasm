What the hell happened here? Some notes:
What the hell happened here?  - The cell "band" is 10.000 Bytes large. However, there is again no error handling for a pointer moving out of bounds.
What the hell happened here?    meaning that you could theoretically modify stuff like the return address etc. - basically anything on the stack
What the hell happened here?  - Also, I know that not supplying any argument will segfault because I don't check argc

I like to have fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun main
