- **Complexity: <span style="color:#ff5050">Not Stonks</span>** \
    Can you even remember all the commands that your 'shiny new' programming language has to offer? Are you overwhelmed and confused by all the ways a modern programming language can be used for? Well look no further than MemeAssembly! MemeASM is your best choice, since it only supports a tiny fraction of instructions.

## Who is it for?
MemeAssembly is the best choice for...
### ...Silicon Valley Developers :iphone:
When it comes to programs, speed is everything. No user wants to wait minutes for their app to start or to calculate a result. 
Thanks to MemeAssembly, these worries are no more! Due to MemeAssembly's high level of optimisation, your code will be blazingly fast!

### ...Game Developers :video_game:
According to NVIDIA, "Frames win games". \
While high-level programming languages like Java provide a lot of pre-coded Interfaces and classes, they do have one giant drawback: *Speed*. \
Even if the game is great, low performance can be a deal-breaker for most if not all customers! So don't miss out on your potential revenue and give your gamers the highest tier performance - using MemeAssembly!

### ...children learning to code :boy: :girl:
Motivating children to join Computer Science related studies or simply learning to code has been a challenge for years. The solution for this problem is simple yet effective: Learn to code using MemeAssembly. \
[Numerous studies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) have already proven the effectivity of MemeAssembly. Parents often praise MemeAssembly's apprach of combining low-level programming languages with Memes that are easy to remember.
